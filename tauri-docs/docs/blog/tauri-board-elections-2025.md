Robin van Boven

Tauri Board Director

As we continue to be amazed by all the applications you’ve created with Tauri v2, it’s been 4 years since Tauri has become a Programme within [The Commons Conservancy](https://commonsconservancy.org/)! This means we’re preparing for a new round of Tauri Board Director elections for the next term.

## [Board Elections](#board-elections)

[Section titled “Board Elections”](#board-elections)

The Tauri Board of Directors is the central decision-making body for the Tauri Programme and is responsible for its overall health and stability. Additional details can be found at the [Tauri Governance page](/about/governance/).

In order to provide continuity from one year to another, the elections of seats are staggered over the course of 2 years. This means that one year a portion of the seats are elected, and the following year the remaining seats are elected. A Tauri Director seat is an elected position with a term of 2 years. The Board has a minimum of 3 Directors and a maximum of 7.

This year there are 5 seats open for election.

### [Applying for Candidacy](#applying-for-candidacy)

[Section titled “Applying for Candidacy”](#applying-for-candidacy)

There are 3 steps to express interest and apply for candidacy:

  1. Learn about the role of a Tauri Board Director on the [Governance page](/about/governance/#tauri-board--board-directors).
  2. Prepare a written introduction about yourself that covers who you are, your history and relevance to Tauri, and what you would like to bring to the Board. (Examples from previous years can be found at <https://github.com/tauri-apps/governance-and-guidance>).
  3. **Apply prior to July 7th, 2025** by emailing [board@tauri.app](mailto:board@tauri.app) or messaging the `@board` role on the [Tauri Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tauri).


Voting will take place starting on July 7th through July 14th, 2025 where Tauri Working Group Members will cast their votes. We’re expecting to announce the results on or before July 19, 2025. If elected, we’ll ask you to sign [this pledge](https://dracc.commonsconservancy.org/0016/) if you haven’t done so previously.

If you have any questions or would like more information please reach out by emailing [board@tauri.app](mailto:board@tauri.app), messaging the `@board` role on the [Tauri Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tauri).
