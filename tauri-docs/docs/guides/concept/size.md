# App Size

While Tauri by default provides very small binaries it doesn’t hurt to push the limits a bit, so here are some tips and tricks for reaching optimal results.

## [Cargo Configuration](#cargo-configuration)

[Section titled “Cargo Configuration”](#cargo-configuration)

One of the simplest frontend agnostic size improvements you can do to your project is adding a Cargo profile to it.

Dependent on whether you use the stable or nightly Rust toolchain the options available to you differ a bit. It’s recommended you stick to the stable toolchain unless you’re an advanced user.

  * [ Stable ](#tab-panel-606)
  * [ Nightly ](#tab-panel-607)


src-tauri/Cargo.toml
[code]
    [profile.dev]
    
    incremental = true # Compile your binary in smaller steps.
    
    
    
    
    [profile.release]
    
    codegen-units = 1 # Allows LLVM to perform better optimization.
    
    lto = true # Enables link-time-optimizations.
    
    opt-level = "s" # Prioritizes small binary size. Use `3` if you prefer speed.
    
    panic = "abort" # Higher performance by disabling panic handlers.
    
    strip = true # Ensures debug symbols are removed.
[/code]

src-tauri/Cargo.toml
[code]
    [profile.dev]
    
    incremental = true # Compile your binary in smaller steps.
    
    rustflags = ["-Zthreads=8"] # Better compile performance.
    
    
    
    
    [profile.release]
    
    codegen-units = 1 # Allows LLVM to perform better optimization.
    
    lto = true # Enables link-time-optimizations.
    
    opt-level = "s" # Prioritizes small binary size. Use `3` if you prefer speed.
    
    panic = "abort" # Higher performance by disabling panic handlers.
    
    strip = true # Ensures debug symbols are removed.
    
    trim-paths = "all" # Removes potentially privileged information from your binaries.
    
    rustflags = ["-Cdebuginfo=0", "-Zthreads=8"] # Better compile performance.
[/code]

## [Remove Unused Commands](#remove-unused-commands)

[Section titled “Remove Unused Commands”](#remove-unused-commands)

In Pull Request [`feat: add a new option to remove unused commands`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/12890), we added in a new option in the tauri config file

tauri.conf.json
[code]
    {
    
      "build": {
    
        "removeUnusedCommands": true
    
      }
    
    }
[/code]

to remove commands that’re never allowed in your capability files (ACL), so you don’t have to pay for what you don’t use

How does it work under the hood?

`tauri-cli` will communicate with `tauri-build` and the build script of `tauri`, `tauri-plugin` through an environment variable and let them generate a list of allowed commands from the ACL, this will then be used by the `generate_handler` macro to remove unused commands based on that

An internal detail is this environment variable is currently `REMOVE_UNUSED_COMMANDS`, and it’s set to project’s directory, usually the `src-tauri` directory, this is used for the build scripts to find the capability files, and although it’s not encouraged, you can still set this environment variable yourself if you can’t or don’t want to use `tauri-cli` to get this to work (**do note that as this is an implementation detail, we don’t guarantee the stability of it**)
